# A Self-Organizing Recurrent Neural Network (SORN)
A SORN repository for general purposes. This repository is based on the original [SORN repository](https://github.com/chrhartm/SORN) by Christoph Hartmann.  

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/)
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [bunch](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bunch)
* [powerlaw](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/powerlaw) (for the NeuronalAvalanches project, from Del Papa et al. 2017)

### Installing

## Projects

Each different project has it's own project folder (for example, 'CountingTask'), which contain it's parameters, experiment instructions, sources and plot files.

### CountingTask

This task is the reimplementation of the counting task from the original SORN paper by [Lazar et al. 2009](http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/neuro.10.023.2009/full).
